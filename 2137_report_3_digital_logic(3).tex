\section*{Summary}

In this lab we started to think in a different mind set. As future engineers it is very important to have a desired function and work backwards to find the circuit that would do said function. In this lab where to build three different adders. The half adder, the full adder and the rippler adder. Not only by building these logic circuits did we start to think in this mindset but we were also introduced to logic chips. These chips have simple logic gates inside of them that allow us to compact our circuits. The half adder has two inputs and outputs a sum and a carry bit. This gives it four possibilities. The half adder has two basic logic gates in order to work, the AND gate and the exclusive OR gate. The full adder consists of two half adders. The full adder has three inputs including a carry input and has two outputs sum and carry. Finally the 2-bit rippler adder consists of two full adders chained together. The rippler adder has five inputs and has three outputs which are sum one, sum two and carry. 


\section*{Q\&A}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Which gates could we use for combining the carry bits? Which one should we use and why?
	
	
	Answer: We could use an exclusive OR gate or either an normal OR gate. We can use either gate because the net result will have one or the other carry active and never both. Meaning that there will only be one input into the gate. Therefore, both the exclusive OR and normal OR gate will work. Though a normal OR gate is simpler to create we are given exclusive OR gates therefore its easiest to use what is at our disposal. 
	
\end{enumerate}
